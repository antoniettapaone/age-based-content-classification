# Safeguarding Minors: Age-Based Classification of Online Multimedia Content

This repository contains code and documentation for the PhD research project by Antonietta Paone on automatically classifying online multimedia content by age appropriateness using NLP and machine learning techniques.

## üìë Description

The goal is to support age-based classification of online content (TED, YouTube, etc.) to protect minors. Transcripts were analyzed using classical machine learning models, deep neural networks, and transformer-based language models. A bad words filter was used to flag and correct misclassified adult content.

## üß† Models Used

### Classical ML (TF-IDF + GridSearchCV)
- SVM
- Naive Bayes
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors

### Deep Learning
- CNN (with dropout and max-pooling)
- LSTM / BiLSTM

### Transformer Models (via Hugging Face)
- BERT / mBERT / DistilBERT
- RoBERTa / ELECTRA
- AlBERTo, GilBERTo, UmBERTo

### LLMs (Large Language Models)
- GPT-2
- Flan-T5
- Minerva

All models were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation. Predictions were further corrected using a custom ‚Äúbad words‚Äù dictionary, adjusting child-labeled texts containing inappropriate language.

## üß™ Datasets

The datasets are structured in three folders:
0_bambini/     ‚Üí Children-appropriate transcripts  
1_ragazzi/     ‚Üí Teens-appropriate content  
2_adulti/      ‚Üí Adult or unsuitable content  

The corpora were compiled from a mix of existing and manually collected resources:

- **TED2020** (Reimers & Gurevych, 2020): 196 English and 202 Italian TED Talk transcripts, originally translated by volunteers. Selected for thematic variety and quality.
- **TVOKids** (EN): Transcripts of preschool and school-age videos manually collected from tvokids.com.
- **YouTube Kids** (IT): Subtitles extracted from videos aimed at different age groups (Preschool to 12 y/o).
- **OpenSubtitles** (EN/IT): Horror and adult-genre subtitles, filtered by language.
- **YouTube Poop (YTP)** (EN/IT): Informal adult content scraped from YouTube, manually reviewed and adjusted.

All texts were annotated for age suitability and thematic indicators (e.g., bad language, drugs, violence) using a custom tagset based on AGCOM's classification guidelines.

The final dataset includes:
- **English**: 446 texts
- **Italian**: 514 texts
  
‚ö†Ô∏è A portion of the texts was extracted using web scraping techniques, strictly for academic research purposes only. Users are kindly requested to use the data for non-commercial, research-related activities only and to respect content copyright.

## üìö Dictionaries

Three domain-specific dictionaries were created manually and semi-automatically:
- **Violence Dictionary**
- **Drug Dictionary**
- **Bad Language Dictionary**
- *Bad Words list*

‚ö†Ô∏è The **English dictionaries** were developed in the context of the work by Maisto et al.

‚ö†Ô∏è The NRC Emotion Intensity Lexicon (Mohammad & Turney, 2013; Mohammad et al., 2018) was also extended and translated into Italian to assist with emotional analysis. The translated and modified version is not included in this repository due to redistribution restrictions.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Execution (Colab-based)

All notebooks were run using Google Colab. Key dependencies:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow nltk transformers tqdm

Mount your Google Drive inside notebooks:
from google.colab import drive  
drive.mount('/content/drive')

Models were trained and evaluated with automatic reporting and post-prediction filtering.
